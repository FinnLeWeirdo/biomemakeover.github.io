### Ghost Town  
Ghost towns are village like structures that generate in Badlands biomes.  

[Ghosts](../features/mobs#ghost) spawn throughout the town, haunting the land they once thrived in. 

While most of the loot has already be pillaged, [Ghost Town Music Disks](../content/items/ghost_town_music_disk) and [Cowboy hats](../features/wearable#cowboy_hat) are among the unique items that can be found within the town.
