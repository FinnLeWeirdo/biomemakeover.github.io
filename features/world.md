## Ghost Town  
Ghost towns are village like structures that generate in Badlands biomes.  

[Ghosts](../features/mobs#ghost) spawn throughout the town, haunting the land they once thrived in. 

While most of the loot has already be pillaged, [Ghost Town Music Disks](../content/items/ghost_town_music_disk) and [Cowboy hats](../features/wearable#cowboy_hat) are among the unique items that can be found within the town.

## Paydirt 
Paydirt patches generate in Badlands biomes, near water. 

Breaking the block with a shovel will drop a variety of ores and gems.

## Tumbleweed  
Tumbleweed can be found bouncing around the badlands. It's purely cosmetic.

## Reeds and Cattails  
Reeds and cattails generate in patches around shallow areas of swamp water. They can be harvested with shears and must be placed in 1 deep water.

## Small Lily Pads  
Small lily pads generate in ground of 1 - 4 in swamp biomes.  

## Water Lily  
Water lilies are flowered versions of the vanilla lily pads. They can be crafted into magenta dye.

## Swamp Flowers  
Orange marigold and White swamp azalea flowers generate in the swamp biome. They act as any other two tall flower.  

## Sunken Ruins  
These partially submerged structures generate in swamp biomes. Various loot can be found in these buildings, but beware, there are witches about.

## Peat  
Peat generates in shallow areas of the swamp. You may see some mossy peat sticking up through the ground.  
Peat can be tilled to create a fast growing farmland alternative or dried to create various decoration blocks.
