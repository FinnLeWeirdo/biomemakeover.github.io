## Ectoplasm
Using ectoplasm in a composter (that has already had some compostable material placed in it) will consume the ectoplasm. This will cause the composter to create soul soil.  
Ectoplasm can be inserted into a composter via a hopper.

Ectoplasm is dropped by [Ghosts](../features/mobs#ghost). 

## Poltergeist
The poltergeist is a block that will interact with blocks around it in a 5x5 radius. 

It interacts with:  
* Doors  
* Buttons  
* Trapdoors  
* Levers  
* Noteblocks  
* Fence Gates  
* Bells

It can be toggled on/off with a redstone signal.
