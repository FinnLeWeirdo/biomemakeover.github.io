# Badlands

## Content

### [Ghost Towns](../features/world#ghost-town)  
Abandoned towns can be found. With no sign of any living inhabitants, these structures contain loot for you to pillage. Though some say the echos of the previous occupants still haunt the land.  

### [Ghosts](../features/mobs#ghost)  
These neutral mobs haunt the ghost towns. They will interact with nearby blocks (levers, doors, buttons, etc.). They drop ectoplasm when killed.

### [Ectoplasm](../features/interactables#ectoplasm)
This item dropped by ghosts can be used to craft the poltergeist or can convert composting materials into soul soil using a composter.

### [Poltergeist](../features/interactables#poltergeist) 
This block can be crafted with ectoplasm. This block will act like the ghosts, interacting with various blocks around it in a 5x5 radius.

### [Paydirt](../features/world#paydirt)  
Paydirt generates near water. Breaking this block will drop various ores.

### Fossils  
Vanilla fossils will generate on the surface of the biome.

### [Barrel Cactus](../features/cactus#barrel-cactus)  
This small cactus generates on red sand throughout the mesa. Over time, this cactus grows a pink flower. When a Scuttler ears this flower, a pink petal is dropped.

### [Saguaro Cactus](../features/cactus#saguaro-cactus)  
Saguaro cactus is a large cactus with branching arms. A single piece of this cactus can be bonemealed to grow it into it's large form.  

### [Tumbleweed](../features/world#tumbleweed)  
Cosmetic tumbleweed will occasionally bounce through the mesa.

### [Scuttler](../features/mobs#scuttler)  
The scuttler is a small, lizard/scorpion-like creature. This creature isn't dangerous, but it will try warn you off with it's rattling tail. Occasionally this animal will eat a flowered barrel cactus, producing pink petals.  
Feeding pink petals to a scuttler will stop it from running away from you, also causing it to enter love mode, allowing it to breed.

### [Bandits](../features/mobs#bandit)  
Patrols of cowboy bandits have been seen through the badlands. These bandits are equipped with crossbows, cowboy hats and a unique banner.

### [Cowboy hats](../features/wearable#cowboy_hat)  
Cowboy hats are stylish hats that can be found within Ghost towns or dropped by bandits.  

### Terracotta Bricks  
Terracotta of all colours can be crafted into decorative terracotta bricks.
